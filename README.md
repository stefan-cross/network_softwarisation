# Network Softwarisation

Sandbox with various tools for SDN and NFV research.

Currently using Vagrant to build Ubuntu Liniux boxes and installing Mininet on them. 

The idea is to include more software, tools and scripts to make it easier to get this SDN/NFV env set up in the future. 

## TODO
- Consider provisioning tools, puppet/chef and even the role of docker
- Should this project be built froma Vagarnt box or use the Vagrant SHELL script to provision the box
- Should we have the project folder set up as a Vagrant external shared folder?
